 Title: Intelligent Task Flow & Form Management System
Developed by: Jatin Gola
Company: Muxro Technologies
Platform: MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

1️⃣ Executive Summary
This system is a full-stack, cloud-based workflow automation platform. It helps organizations define task flows, assign tasks dynamically, collect structured data via forms, and track performance — all powered by a custom-built rule engine, MongoDB backend, and modern React dashboard.

2️⃣ Objective
To replace static Google-based systems with a scalable backend, enabling:

Configurable task flows

Role/email-based assignment

Custom forms at each task step

Real-time dashboards and performance analytics

MongoDB-backed data persistence

Server-hosted architecture (no Google Sheets or Apps Script)

3️⃣ Key Features
Feature	Description
✅ Task Flow Engine	Automatically creates, progresses, and assigns tasks based on JSON-defined flow rules
✅ Form Builder	Drag-and-drop schema builder with 15+ input types
✅ MongoDB Storage	All tasks and form responses stored in collections
✅ Role-Based View	Each user only sees their tasks
✅ Flow ID Tracking	All tasks/forms linked to unique flow ID
✅ Form Response Viewer	Shows all responses for a specific Flow ID
✅ Analytics	Charts showing on-time completion, bottlenecks
✅ OrgChart	Visual task map showing flow rules and step-wise performance

4️⃣ System Architecture
Layer	Technology
Frontend	React.js, Bootstrap 5, Chart.js, Google Charts
Backend	Node.js, Express.js
Database	MongoDB Atlas
Storage	GridFS or AWS S3 (for file uploads)
Auth (optional)	JWT or session-based access control

5️⃣ Data Structure
🧩 Flow Rules (Collection: flow_rules)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "system": "CRM Onboarding",
  "current_task": "",
  "status": "",
  "next_task": "Step 1",
  "tat": 2,
  "tat_type": "Day",
  "doer": "Sales Executive",
  "email": "sales@example.com",
  "form_id": "f001"
}
📌 Task (Collection: tasks)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "system": "CRM Onboarding",
  "flow_id": "CRM001",
  "order_number": "ORD001",
  "task_name": "Step 1",
  "planned_time": ISODate,
  "actual_time": null,
  "doer_email": "sales@example.com",
  "status": null
}
📄 Form Template (Collection: form_templates)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "form_id": "f001",
  "title": "Client Entry",
  "description": "Basic info form",
  "questions": [
    { "label": "Client Name", "type": "text", "required": true }
  ]
}
📤 Form Responses (Collection: form_responses_<taskname>)
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "flow_id": "CRM001",
  "response_id": "resp_001",
  "task_name": "Step 1",
  "submitted_by": "sales@example.com",
  "timestamp": ISODate,
  "form_data": {
    "Client Name": "ABC Pvt Ltd",
    "Remarks": "Ready for follow-up",
    "Files": "S3_URL"
  }
}
6️⃣ Flow Logic
🟢 startFlow()
Finds flow rule where current_task == ""

Generates first task with TAT calculation

Inserts into tasks collection

✅ markDone()
Updates current task: actual_time, status

Triggers nextTask() based on flow_rules

🔁 nextTask()
Looks up matching rule for (current_task, status)

Creates new task, sets doer and planned_time

7️⃣ Form System
Field Type	Supported
Short Answer	✅
Paragraph	✅
Dropdown	✅
Checkboxes	✅
Radio	✅
File Upload	✅
Table Input	✅
Date/Time/Scale	✅
Rating & Grid	✅

8️⃣ Security & Access
Auth via JWT (recommended)

Users only fetch tasks where doer_email == user_email

Form responses log submitted_by field

9️⃣ Modules
1. 📋 Task Tracker (/dashboard)
Shows tasks for current user

Buttons for Mark Done, Fill Form, View Forms

2. 🏗 Form Builder (/admin/form-builder)
Admin UI to design and save form schema

3. 📝 Form Renderer (/form/:form_id?flow_id=...)
Loads and renders schema from DB

Submits responses to MongoDB

4. 📈 Reporting Dashboard (/report)
Stats: Completed %, On-time %, Avg delay

Bar charts for bottlenecks

5. 🗺 OrgChart (/flow-map)
Task transition map based on flow_rules

6. 📂 Flow Viewer (/flow/:flow_id)
Shows all forms submitted under one flow

🔟 Analytics & Charts
Metric	Description
Total Tasks	Count of all tasks
Completed Tasks	Tasks where actual_time != null
On-Time Completion %	Tasks with actual_time < planned_time
Avg Delay	Aggregated delay per task step
Bottleneck	Task with highest avg delay
OrgChart	Tree of task transitions with % success

1️⃣1️⃣ Benefits
✅ No dependency on Google Workspace

✅ Full control over backend + frontend

✅ Custom flows, forms, dashboards

✅ Modern UI/UX and responsive components

✅ Easy scalability to 1000s of tasks

1️⃣2️⃣ Future Enhancements
Feature	Priority
Email/WhatsApp Reminders	High
PDF Export of Responses	Medium
Mobile App (React Native)	High
Approval Matrix / Hierarchy	Medium
Drag & Drop Flow Designer	Long Term

📦 Deliverables
File	Description
server/	Express backend with models/controllers/routes
client/	React frontend with dashboard, form builder, reporting
MongoDB	Collections: flow_rules, tasks, form_templates, form_responses_*
Docker (optional)	For containerized deployment
.env	Stores DB and secret config
