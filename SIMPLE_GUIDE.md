# Process Sutra - Simple Guide for Everyone

## What Does This Tool Do?

Imagine you have a lot of work that needs to pass through different people in your company - like getting a new customer signed up, processing an order, or approving a leave request. Process Sutra helps you organize and track all this work automatically, so nothing gets lost or forgotten.

Think of it as a **smart to-do list manager** that:
- Automatically assigns work to the right people
- Reminds people when tasks are due
- Shows you how your team is performing
- Keeps track of everything that happens

## Simple Explanation by Page

### 🏠 Home Page (Dashboard)
**What you see when you log in**

This is like the dashboard in your car - it shows you everything important at a glance:
- How many tasks are pending (like items on your to-do list)
- How many are completed (done!)
- How many are overdue (uh-oh, past deadline)
- How well you and your team are doing

**For managers**: You also get charts showing which workflows are fast, which are slow, and who's doing great work.

---

### 📋 My Tasks
**Your personal work inbox**

This is where you see all the work assigned to you, just like an email inbox but for tasks.

**What you can do**:
- See what needs to be done
- Click on a task to view details
- Fill out forms (like answering questions about the work)
- Mark tasks as "Done" when finished
- If you're too busy, pass a task to someone else
- Search to find a specific task quickly

**Example**: If you work in customer service, you might see tasks like "Call new customer" or "Process refund request".

### 🔄 Workflows (For Managers Only)
**Setting up how work flows through your company**

Think of this as creating a recipe for how work should move. Like:
1. Customer submits order → Goes to Sales team
2. Sales approves → Goes to Warehouse
3. Warehouse ships → Goes to Accounts
4. Accounts sends invoice → Task complete

**You decide**:
- Who does each step
- How long each step should take
- What happens next based on the result (approved/rejected)
- What forms people need to fill out

**Real-life example**: Setting up a "New Employee Joining" process:
- HR creates joining form
- IT sets up computer
- Admin arranges desk
- Manager does orientation
- HR completes paperwork

---

### 🎨 Visual Workflow Designer
**Draw your workflows instead of typing**

Instead of writing out the workflow steps, you can draw them! It's like creating a flowchart:
- Drag boxes around to represent different tasks
- Connect them with arrows showing the flow
- Click on any box to edit details
- See the whole process in one picture

**Why this is helpful**: It's much easier to understand and explain workflows when you can see them visually. Plus, you can spot problems (like missing steps) more easily.

---

### 📝 Form Creator
**Make custom forms without any coding**

Need to collect information from people? Create forms just like Google Forms, but integrated into your workflows.

**Types of questions you can add**:
- Short answer (like "What's your name?")
- Long answer (like "Describe the issue")
- Multiple choice (choose one option)
- Checkboxes (choose multiple options)
- Date picker (select a date from calendar)
- File upload (attach documents or photos)
- Tables (for multiple items, like expense entries)

**Bonus features**:
- Automatically send emails when someone submits the form
- Send WhatsApp notifications
- Upload files directly to Google Drive

**Example**: Create a "Customer Complaint Form" with questions about the issue, priority level, and attach screenshots.

---

### ⏰ Time Settings
**Tell the system when you work**

Set your office hours so the system knows when to count time:
- Office opens at: 9:00 AM
- Office closes at: 6:00 PM
- Weekends: Saturday & Sunday (don't count these days)
- Your timezone: Choose your location

**Why this matters**: If someone has 2 days to complete a task, the system won't count nights and weekends. So it's fair and realistic.

---

### 👥 Team Management
**Add and manage your team members**

This is where managers add people who will use the system:
- Add new team members (just enter their email)
- Assign roles (Manager or Team Member)
- See who's active
- View what everyone is working on

**Two types of users**:
- **Team Members**: Can see and complete their own tasks
- **Managers**: Can do everything - create workflows, see all tasks, manage the team

---

### 🏢 Company Settings
**Your company information**

Fill in your company details so everyone knows who you are:
- Company name
- Address and phone number
- Business type (Are you a retailer? Manufacturer?)
- Customer type (Do you serve businesses or regular customers?)
- Tax ID (like GST number in India)

This information appears on forms and reports.

---

### 👤 My Profile
**Your personal account settings**

Manage your personal information:
- View your email and role
- Update your details
- Connect Google Drive (to save files there automatically)

**For managers**: Also edit company information from here.

---

### 📊 Submitted Forms
**See all form responses in one place**

View every form that has been filled out:
- Search by customer name, order number, or date
- Filter to see only specific types of forms
- Click to view complete details
- Export to Excel for further analysis

**Example use**: Check all customer feedback forms submitted last month.

---

### 💾 Data Backup & Delete
**Export or remove your data**

**Export options** (save your data):
- Download all workflows as a file
- Export all form submissions to Excel
- Get all uploaded files in a zip
- Save user information

**Delete options** (permanently remove):

---

### 📈 Usage & Limits
**Track how much you're using the system**

See your usage like a phone data plan:
- How many team members you have (vs your limit)
- How many workflows are running
- How much file storage you're using
- What it's costing you

**Visual meters** show you when you're getting close to limits, so you can upgrade if needed.

---

### 🧪 Test Your Workflows
**Try before you go live**

Before using a workflow with real work, test it first!

Run simulations to see:
- How long the workflow will take
- Where bottlenecks might happen (slow points)
- If tasks pile up at certain steps
- How to make it faster

**It's like**: Running a fire drill before an actual emergency. You find and fix problems when it doesn't matter yet.
